## CSV Demo
`csvDemo.py` demos how to read, write, and append rows to a local csv file `leaderboard.csv`. 

## SQLite Demo
`SQLiteDemo.ipynb` demos how to create a connection to a SQLite database and make basic SQL queries. The demo can be run using Jupyter Notebook and the code in each cell can be executed in a Python file on VSCode or your IDE of choice.
